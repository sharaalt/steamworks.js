***Stats Doccumentation***
This part of the Doccumentation will be covering how to access stats and edit stats.

<h2>Getting the value</h2>
Before starting you should check if you already have a stats copy it's API name and follow the example changing it along the way. If you don't have a stat already made you have to make one before starting, to do this go to your app dashboard -> app admin -> Stats & Achievements -> Stats. From there you click on "New Stat" and fill out the information then you copy the API name as we will need that later.
